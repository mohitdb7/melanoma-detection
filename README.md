## General Information
**Melanoma Detection** - To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Training and validation accuracy are very close to each other at the last epoch however they are fluctuating a lot
- Training accuracy at 30th epoch was 82% and validation accuracy was 78%
- Due to fluctuation, we can say that we see signs of overfitting here
- Model is able to classify 78% of images accurately
